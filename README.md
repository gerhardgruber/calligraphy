# calligraphy
calligraphy is a JavaScript WYSIWYG editor without usage of the [contenteditable](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_contenteditable.asp) attribute.

The repository contains just a pre-pre-pre-alpha version of the editor.
I just spent a few hours on doing the basic-stuff.

calligraphy uses the [raphaeljs](http://raphaeljs.com) library internally to render the editor and its content.

In addition to raphaeljs, [jquery](http://jquery.com) is required.
